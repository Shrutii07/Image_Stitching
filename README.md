# Image_Stitching

Goal of this repo is to creates a Panorama from a set of images. The images may not be in order of apperences. This repo also contains code of Harris corner written from scratch. It compares SIFT and Harris features for image stitching. A report of this project can be found at [Report-Panorama.pdf](Report-Panorama.pdf). Feel free to raise issue or contact the contributors in case of any doubts or development of this code. 
*Note: this code will not work for cylindrical panoramas*
